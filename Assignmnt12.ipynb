    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. \n",
    "It is a way to handle errors or exceptional situations that can occur \n",
    "while the program is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Exceptions: Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when something unexpected or erroneous happens. They are raised when \n",
    "the program encounters an error condition that it cannot handle or when a specific condition specified by the programmer is met. \n",
    "Exceptions can be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors: Syntax errors occur during the parsing of the code, before the program starts executing. \n",
    "They are caused by violations of the language's syntax rules. These errors indicate that the code is not written correctly and \n",
    "cannot be executed until the syntax errors are fixed. Common examples of syntax errors include misspelled keywords, missing colons, \n",
    "or incorrect indentation."
